        First Question: Hmmm...How does the internet web function?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The internet is a web of equipments which are talking to each other in terms of electrical signal and bits/bytes. For instance, if a smartphone accesses a webpage like www.google.com, the computer inside the smartphone sends a 
          <span class="italic">HTTP Request</span> to 
          a <span class="italic">server</span>. 
        </p> 
          <div class="image"><img src="images/internet.jpg" alt="This shows a picture of internet"></div>
        
        <p>
          On the other side, the server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends 
          it back to the user's computer where a <span class="italic">
          web browser</span> interprets the page and displays it on 
          the user's screen. 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onzTRvuOWSM">this is shown in this video</a> for further detail.

        HTML

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup 
          Language.</span> when people search for information in written text online, it is esentially displayed on user's screen as HTML which is translated by the browser to general readable text. 
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain <span class="italic">text 
          content</span> which describes "what you see" and 
          <span class="italic">markup</span> which describes 
          "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This 
          video</a> gives a good overview.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that dot HTML file contains the structure of the documents in terms of tags, elements nested to form a boxes like structures.

        Tags and Elements

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML documents esentially contain
          <span class="bold">elements</span>. When we write HTML, we 
          tell the browsers what type of each element by assigning them HTML <span class="bold">tags</span>. 
          <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the

        <p>
          In this case, Computers can be called as stupid because they interpret 
          instructions literally. This makes them very 
          unforgiving since a small mistake by a 
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program. If the data we provide, in terms of programming, has not been written in the way computer is expecting it to process, computer will not have a way to process it otherwise!

        What are Inline and Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Elements in HTML are either <span class="bold">inline</span> 
          or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements can be visualised as an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

        <p>
          HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> 
          or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form 
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. The div tags are use to enclose contents. There could be a seried of div boxes nested from the top of page to the bottom, forming a tree like structure.

        What is The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML 
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can 
          draw this relationship like a family tree. For instance, each Country has states, each state has the cities, each city has towns and villages and so on and so forth
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series 
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes 
          inside of boxes, and so on...

        Why use the indentation when writing HTML code
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML documents are written in way
          that either the text editor, explained below, or the person creating the document generates  a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is, showing a tree like structure within the document.

        What Text editor to use
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          There are quite a few text editors available online free to be downloaded, in addition to the default version as notepad, for windows and textedit, for OSX. Text Wrangler, Sublime text are just 2 great examples. One of the benifits of the text editors is they format the text in terms of indentations etc for the syntax that is being written. For instance, HTML and CSS syntax can be written while text editor provides the predictive text list while known commands are being written such as div, p, class etc. The key is to save the filename as soon as a new document is open in the .HTML or .CSS format so that the Text Editor can treat the text according to the style and indentation applicable to the text.

        CSS-Adding style while avoiding repeatation
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style sheet. It is a language used to define the style of the structure that is already defined in the .HTML file. A folder may contain more than one style sheets, however, it needs to be colocated on the folder that contains the .HTML and it needs to be named .CSS. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          CSS is used to define the font, weight and size of the font, color, borders and position of the Boxes. The .HTML file can provide the information of what style to use and where to get it from. The dot CSS side of the style sheet then link each element from the structure to assigned style in the dot CSS file. In other words, CSS brings life and color to the plain text and enables the structure to hold links to multimedia such as Images, Videos etc in such a way that viewer is not overwhelmed by the redundency of information to process. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note the while repeating the chunks of code is an important skill when creating the structured documents such as HTML, It is not a technique which should be sought after.
          </p>  
          <p>
          CSS brings forth one of most import ideas in Computer Programming <em> not to repeat yourself </em>. This avoiding of repeatation can really help a person make good code. The key concept is called<b> Inheritance</b>. According to a www.w3.org article, " Each property may also have a cascaded value of 'inherit', which means that, for a given element, the property takes the same specified value as the property for the element's parent. The 'inherit' value can be used to enforce inheritance of values, and it can also be used on properties that are not normally inherited.""
        </p>
        <p> Additionally, in my opinon, Repeating code means more character in the file which translates into a larger file size. Larger CSS style sheet will take longer to be transfered, to be loaded. That will require more bandwidth to be allocated between machines and more processing power at the user end. That will also require storage/cache issues as a bigger picture. If repeatation can be avoided and inheritance can be utilized, many of those issues will subside.
